/* The geom_t type represents the geometry of the spherical triangle.
 * The triangle is defined by the angles at the three vertices.
 *
 * In the computations, expansions from one, two or all three vertices
 * are used. Each expansion uses a different parameterization of the
 * sphere (the north pole of the sphere is placed at the vertex from
 * which the expansion originates and one of the other vertices is
 * taken to have phi equal to zero). Because of this all value which
 * depend on the parameterization has three instances, one for each
 * choice of vertex to place at the north pole.
 *
 * fmpq * angles: Contains the three angles for the three different
 * vertices.
 *
 * arb_ptr v1[3]: Coordinates for the vertex places on the north pole
 * (this will always be [0, 0, 1]).
 *
 * arb_ptr v2[3]: Coordinates for the vertex having y equal to zero.
 *
 * arb_ptr v3[3]: Coordinates for the third vertex.
 *
 * int vertices[3]: Flags for which vertices to use expansions from (1
 * to use it, 0 to not use it).
 *
 * int half_edge[3]: Flags for which expansions only half the the edge
 * is to be used in the computations, in general because of symmetry
 * reasons.
